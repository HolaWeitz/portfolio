                "The photographs from satellites show us gorgeous views of the land. We are always focusing on the scene in tiny scale. However, when you set one step, three steps, five steps back, you would get rather breathtaking beauty. This process resembles my journey, in which I explore my knowledge to broader fields. It is kept in my mind that every site, with unique characteristic, deserved to be respected and restore to vitality. From various projects I was involved, I get to know landscape design would be interpreted in many ways. I used to consider sites as units emerging from the interaction of landscape forming factors. However, after finished several practical projects, I went further to understand sites as a heterogeneous combination of patchy multiple-elements. It becomes obvious that many high-quality designs are carried out concentrating on specific services or specific linkages within sites and human life activities. Futhermore landscape archtecture should be more a solutions for a relation of region characteristics, environment, services, benefits and values for society, rather than a simple aesthetic combination."
