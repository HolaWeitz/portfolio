However, when you set one step, three steps, five steps back, you would get rather breathtaking beauty. This process resembles my journey, in which I explore my knowledge to broader fields. It is kept in my mind that every site, with unique characteristic, deserved to be respected and restore to vitality. From various projects I was involved, I get to know landscape design would be interpreted in many ways. I used to consider sites as units emerging from the interaction of landscape forming factors. However, after finished several practical projects, I went further to understand sites as a heterogeneous combination of patchy multiple-elements. It becomes obvious that many high-quality designs are carried out concentrating on specific services or specific linkages within sites and human life activities. Futhermore landscape archtecture should be more a solutions for a relation of region characteristics, environment, services, benefits and values for society, rather than a simple aesthetic combination."
